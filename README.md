# Welcome to bitcoin++ conference series!

Bitcoin++ is a developer-focused conference series dedicated to advancing Bitcoin technology through in-depth lectures and hands-on workshops. Emphasizing small, focused audiences, the series fosters deep dives into cutting-edge Bitcoin developments. 

Since its inception in June 2022, Bitcoin++ has hosted events in global tech hubs, including Austin, Mexico City, Berlin, and Buenos Aires. Each conference centers on specific themes such as on-chain privacy, Layer 2 solutions, and e-cash, attracting experts, educators, and builders from the Bitcoin ecosystem to share insights and onboard developers and users.
